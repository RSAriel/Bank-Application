### Work in Progress... ###

This is the backend for a  simple banking app where you can create users, add or remove money from their accounts and make transactions between them. I have plans to improve it by doing security enhancements (like Authentication and Authorization), more features for the clients and refactor the code with better SpringBoot annotations for the task like @Transaction.

A MySql database schema is needed for the project to work properly and there is a small documentation for the API at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/ when you run it.
